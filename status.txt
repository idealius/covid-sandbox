Main Features:

Rolling average slider.
Always fills curves transparently -- mostly for aesthetic reasons, but also because it is sometimes easier to visualize differences between regions.
Totals printed to text area for ranking comparison across N number of days.
Ranking in the graph by total or peak.
Ability to add N top regions in a dataset by last N number of days. For seeing say the bottom 10 regions, one can add the top N regions, then remove the (N - 10) regions.
